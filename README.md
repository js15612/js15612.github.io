# Greetings, my name is Jacob

**Ambitious, diligent, and a desire for more knowledge; I'm looking for an internship position to further my expand my knowledge in engineering otuside of my classwork to better serve myself and my Baja SAE team.** 

## Summary

Currently studying mechanical engineering at Georgia Southern University; involvement as design and organization officer for the school's motorsports team; interested in opportunities with the automotive and aerospace industries; hobbies include filmmaking, music, kayaking, and coding projects

### B.S.M.E., Fall '19

I'm a junior mechanical engineering student at Georgia Southern University, expecting to graduate in the Fall of 2019.  I actively participate in my school's Society of Automotive Engineers chapter, which I have been a member of since the beginning of Fall 2015. I currently serve as both the Drivetrain Design Lead for Baja SAE and the Campus Outreach lead for SAE.

I am actively looking to obtain an internship or co-op position with a company that will utilize both my classroom knowledge and my experience with Baja SAE.

### Baja SAE

I have been a part of the school's Society of Automotive Engineer's chapter since the beginning of Fall 2015, my first semester at Georgia Southern.  My freshman year comprised of manufacturing spacers, suspension tabs, and other small-scale components while I learn about the different subsystems such as suspension and drivetrain.

My sophomore year was spent redesigning the braking system to reduce plastic deformation of our brake rotors while maintaining a lightweight system durable enough to undergo 200+ hours of testing and 8 hours of dynamics events, including a 4 hour endurance race.

As of right now, my junior year is being spent redesigning the Baja car's drivetrain, including both the Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT) and the gearbox.  Current plans include:
1. Modifying the CVT to allow for a greater range of ratios, which will increase our overall top speed and/or our torque generated at the wheel.
2. Reduce the weight of the overall system, which will increase the efficiency of our drivetrain by eliminating mass moment of inertia.
3. Changing the material of the gears within the gearbox to materials with better durability and lighter weight, to improve efficiency and packaging.
